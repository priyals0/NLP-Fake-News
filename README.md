# NLP-Fake-News

DATASET: Fake news detection using Liar dataset (https://github.com/tfs4/liar_dataset)
- two files we used: test.tsv and train.tsv, where you can see our original testing and training data

method_baseine --> folder containing Jupyter notebook (baselines.ipynb) where we preprocessed data and ran Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM

method_cnn --> folder containing Jupyter notebook (cnn-bagOfWords-colab.ipynb) where we preprocessed for CNN and ran CNN

method_mistral --> folder containing python file (mistral.py) where we ran Mistral, plus two text files that have Mistral's full output and it's predictions. Also contains a json for our (blank) Mistral key.
- in our code, we imported mistral from the mistralai library (https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/clients/) 

kmeans_clustering.py --> python file in which we ran k-means clustering as an initial data exploration

bert.py --> python file in which we tried to run bert

naivebayes_baseline.py --> Bag of Words naive bayes approach to classify news as real or fake (we ended up using this same code in baselines.ipynb)
news marked as true is real, all others (fake, half-true, pants-on-fire) are marked as false
